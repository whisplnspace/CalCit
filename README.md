# Virtual Hand Gesture Calculator

A **virtual calculator** that uses hand gestures for input, built using OpenCV, the `cvzone` HandTracking module, and Python's `pyttsx3` for voice output. This project leverages a webcam to detect finger positions and simulate button presses on a virtual calculator.

## Features

- **Gesture-Based Input**: Control the calculator using hand gestures (specifically the index and middle fingers) tracked via webcam.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays the calculator's interface and your equation in real time on the screen.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Provides voice feedback, such as announcing errors or when the calculator starts.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses for complex expressions.
- **Clear and Delete Function**: Use `C` to clear the equation or `del` to delete the last input.

## Demo

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- cvzone HandTrackingModule (`cvzone`)
- pyttsx3 (for Text-to-Speech)

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone pyttsx3
```

## How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: The code uses `cvzone` to detect the hand and track finger positions.
2. **Button Interaction**: When the distance between the index and middle fingers becomes small enough, the code registers it as a "click" and interacts with the buttons.
3. **TTS Integration**: The `pyttsx3` library gives voice feedback. For example, it announces the starting of the calculator and reads errors like "Syntax Error."

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whisplnspace/CalCit.git
   cd virtual-hand-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python cvzone pyttsx3
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:

   Run the `main.py` file using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Make sure your webcam is active and functioning, as the hand tracking requires a live video feed.

## Usage

- Use your **index and middle fingers** to "click" on the virtual buttons.
- Basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses can be performed.
- Click the `=` button to evaluate the expression.
- Press `C` to clear the current equation or `del` to delete the last character.

### Keyboard Controls:

- **Press 'q'**: Close the program and exit.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Features**: Add more complex operations such as trigonometry, exponents, etc.
- **Enhanced Gesture Recognition**: Implement multi-hand tracking and gestures for specific operations.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize button layout and themes.
